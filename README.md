# Personal Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, a dynamic and interactive single-page application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. The site features a sleek, modern design with a high-tech aesthetic, including a custom animated background.

## üöÄ Features

* **Interactive Background:** A dynamic, animated background that runs across all sections of the site, creating an immersive user experience.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and optimized for viewing on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
* **Animated "About Me" Section:** A tabbed interface that cleanly separates my professional summary from my educational and career timeline. The timeline features scroll-based animations for an engaging reveal.
* **3D Flip-Card Projects:** An interactive projects section where each project is displayed on a 3D card that flips on hover or tap to reveal more details and a link to the GitHub repository.
* **Smooth Scrolling & Active Navigation:** The navigation bar smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section and highlights the active link based on the user's position on the page.
